## 🏢 Professional & Enterprise Experience  

I’ve had the opportunity to work on **business-critical applications** at companies such as **ALVA** and **SAIC-GM-Wuling**. While the source code is proprietary, the projects highlight my ability to design, develop, and deliver impactful solutions at scale:

  Led end-to-end development of integrated systems to boost efficiency, data accuracy, and production visibility on the factory floor.  

- **CMMS & VMS Solutions**  
  Built internal tools from concept to deployment, including a **Computerized Maintenance Management System (CMMS)** and a **Visitor Management System (VMS)** to optimize workflows.  

- **IIoT & System Integration**  
  Integrated **Industrial IoT devices, PLCs, and ERP systems** into a unified ecosystem for **real-time monitoring and traceability**.  

These projects required strong **system architecture design**, close collaboration with cross-functional teams, and a clear focus on aligning technology with operational goals.
