Hi, I'm Ramadhan Adi Putra 👋

Full Stack Developer with a background in IT/OT, Digital Transformation, and Automation. I specialize in turning complex operational challenges into efficient, easy-to-use digital solutions. My passion lies in bridging the gap between industrial systems and modern web technologies to build a more connected and automated future.

🏢 Professional & Enterprise Experience
In my role at companies like ALVA and SAIC-GM-Wuling, I have developed and managed several business-critical, in-house applications. While the source code for these projects is confidential and proprietary, they demonstrate my ability to deliver impactful solutions in a corporate environment.
Manufacturing Execution Systems (MES) & Quality Information Systems (QIS): Led the end-to-end development of integrated systems to enhance operational efficiency, data accuracy, and production process visibility on the factory floor.
CMMS & VMS Solutions: Built internal tools from concept to deployment, including a Computerized Maintenance Management System (CMMS) and a Visitor Management System (VMS) to optimize internal workflows.
IIoT & System Integration: Spearheaded the integration of Industrial IoT devices, PLCs, and ERP systems to create a unified data ecosystem, enabling real-time monitoring and traceability.
My work in these areas involved a deep understanding of business requirements, system architecture design, and collaboration with cross-functional teams to ensure technology alignment with operational goals.

🚀 Public Portfolio & Personal Projects
I believe in learning by doing. Here are the public projects I'm actively developing to sharpen my skills and share my knowledge:

👨‍💻 Personal Tech Blog - ramadhans.my.id
A professional blog where I document my journey and share insights on full-stack development, DevOps, and cloud technologies.
Tech Stack: Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Shadcn/ui, Firestore, and deployed on Google Cloud Run via a GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline.
This project demonstrates my ability to build a full-stack application from scratch and manage a complete DevOps lifecycle on GCP.

🏫 School Website Modernization (Case Study) - http://libmicikarang.sch.id (On-Going)
Upgrading a real-world school website from a legacy CMS to a modern, high-performance web application to improve user experience and streamline the student registration process.
Tech Stack: Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Vercel, and Supabase (PostgreSQL) for the backend and database.
This project showcases my skills in migrating systems, designing a database schema (SQL), and building a practical, data-driven application.

💻 Tech Stack & Tools
These are the technologies I work with daily. My focus is on building robust, scalable, and maintainable applications.
